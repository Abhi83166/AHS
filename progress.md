# Arunoday Home Systems (HomeHub) - Progress Report

## Project Overview
**Arunoday Home Systems** is a local-first, private smart-home dashboard designed to run on Raspberry Pi with zero cloud hosting costs. The system uses a modular architecture where the static UI is hosted on Sevella (free), while all heavy processing (MQTT, rules, camera proxy, database) runs locally on the Pi.

**Goal**: ₹0/month hosting while maintaining full remote access and a premium, modular dashboard experience.
